The High-Lift Prediction Workshop is a series of workshops sponsored through the American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics, dedicated to improving the prediction of commercial transport aircraft in their takeoff and landing configurations.

## Goals of the Workshop
- Assess the numerical prediction capability (meshing, numerics, turbulence modeling, high-performance computing requirements, etc.) of current-generation CFD technology/codes for swept, medium-to-high-aspect ratio wings for landing/take-off (high-lift) configurations.
- Develop practical modeling guidelines for CFD prediction of high-lift flow fields.
- Determine the elements of high-lift flow physics that are critical for modeling to enable the development of more accurate prediction methods and tools.
- Enhance CFD prediction capability for practical high-lift aerodynamic design and optimization.
